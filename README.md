# Amazon-clone
I'm excited to showcase a simple yet impressive project: my own version of an Amazon clone, created using the dynamic duo of web development markup languages, HTML and CSS. These two languages allowed me to craft a compelling web experience, replicating the essence of one of the internet's biggest e-commerce platforms.
